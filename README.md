# FirebaseUI for web - Ionic demo

This is a sample template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## Firebase console configuration:

To properly configure your Firebase Project please follow all the instructions from the following link, section *Set up Firebase Authentication for Cordova*:

[https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/cordova](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/cordova)

## Run app locally:

````bash
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
````

### Notes
`ionic lab` or `ionic serve --lab` does not work with FirebaseUI, you will have to use `ionic serve` instead.
